itp404Fitness
=============
Greetings and welcome to my ITP404 project. 
It's unfinished and I'm still working on it, but check out what I have so far.
I'm still trying to implement Google Fit into the device instead of using data I created, but other than that I use echonest for music and a weather api to pull weather in your city.
The chart is created using HTML5 canvas and is generated based on your information.

To RUN:

download file
go into directory using terminal
type: php -S localhost:3000

then go to browser and open the gamefit.html page
